## Setup

This aims to simplify and speed up a new Mac setup. 
Covering:
* install and add initial configuration for brew
* some sane terminal emulator (e.g. [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)
* nerd fonts
* shell profile
* engineering setup - stuff I need for work, a chosen tech ecosystem to make things done
* bells and whistles - e.g. [starship](https://starship.rs/), [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa), etc

## Interface

1. Use make to do perform the setup
2. Run `stow {package-name} -t $HOME/.config/` to configure 

## This is not fully automated and complete

Read the files. Not everything is automated.
